# Software Writing

This is a record of pieces I've written on software with an industry focus. My academic publications (which are mainly philosophical) can be found on my [http://eastanglia.academia.edu/RyanDawson](academia.edu page).

## Why Making Software Is So Difficult

This was published in [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2632442](Software Engineering Notes) and under their arrangement I can also publish it [Why Making Software is so Difficult.pdf](here). The aim of the piece is provide a better metaphor that can act as an antidote to the weaknesses of the construction/engineering metaphor that both tends to dominate and which is also often criticised.

## Review of Sandro Mancuso's book The Software Craftsman: Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride

I'd intended this piece for a journal, which didn't happen but I've kept hold of it anyway as the book made an impression on me and I think the review captures that. The review doesn't say much about Mancuso's views on TDD, mostly because I didn't want to get into the 'TDD is dead' debate and [http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/86157842](whether TDD leads to good design). I very much like how Mancuso has illustrated his pragmatic point of view in detail at code level [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHnuMjah6ps](in a series of youtube videos).

## Improving Software Development Cultures

This piece has at its heart a questionnaire-like tool that I'm hoping could be used by teams looking to improve their software development culture. I'm thinking I will submit this somewhere when I'm fully happy with it as it is in draft form right now.
